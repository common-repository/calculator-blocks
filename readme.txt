== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**Do I need an Excelkits account to use this plugin?**

No. The shared widgets are accessable for you to test out this plugin. However if you want to create your own custom widgets and/or upload your own spreadsheets you will need to create an account. Be sure to create an [API Key](https://excelkits.com/account/api-keys) and add it to your Excelkits settings in your Wordpress admin.

[You can create your account here](https://excelkits.com/signup?utm_source=wordpress-plugin-listing&utm_campaign=wordpress&utm_medium=marketplaces).


**How Do Calculator Blocks Work Exactly?**

Simple, first you [sign up for Excelkits](https://excelkits.com/signup?utm_source=wordpress-plugin-listing&utm_campaign=wordpress&utm_medium=marketplaces) and select a starter template. Upload your own spreadsheet and customize the results.  When you are ready, create your [Excelkits API Key](https://excelkits.com/account/api-keys) then add it to your WordPress Excelkits settings menu in the admin.  You should then see your custom widget selectable within the Gutenberg editor's calculator block.


**Will It Work With My Excel/Google Sheets/Etc?**

Yes. Download your sheet as an XLS or XLSX file and upload that file within Excelkits. You can then select your spreadsheet data just as you do for charts and graphs in your favorite spreadsheet software. Be aware not all functions you use may be supported, generally we support functions defined by the [OpenDocument Format](https://docs.oasis-open.org/office/OpenDocument/v1.3/os/part4-formula/OpenDocument-v1.3-os-part4-formula.html).


**Does It Work On Mobile?**

Yes. All layouts are designed for the needs of mobile users first, expanding elegantly as more screen space becomes available.


**Deos It Work With Page Builders?**

No. The Calculator Blocks plugin is for the Wordpress Gutenberg editor and is not compatible with 3rd party page builders such as Elementor and Divi. However Excelkits will still work on these platforms. Simply copy the HTML snippets from the Excelkits editor and paste them into your page builder of choice as custom HTML.


**Can It Integrate With My Wordpress Database?**

Yes. Although currently, it takes a little technical ability in order to integrate it.  Reach out to Excelkits tech support for more details on setting this up.


**How Much Does It Cost?**

It’s free.  However, if you’d like access premium features or support for a large number of widgets you’ll have to purchase a subscription.
